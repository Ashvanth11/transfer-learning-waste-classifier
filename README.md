# transfer-learning-waste-classifier
This project implements efficient transfer learning for classifying images into nine waste categories. Pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, ResNet101, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16) were fine-tuned using Keras, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
